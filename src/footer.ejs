          Strategr is available for macOS only. However, it is written mostly in
          cross-platform C++, and, although it is ready to be ported to various
          platforms, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure
          that its behavior is consistent and UI is top quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Strategr is free and will stay free</strong>, so any
          of your help is appreciated!
        </p>
